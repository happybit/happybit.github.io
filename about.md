I'm P. Zheng, and I'm a software tester working for a telecom vendor. More specifically, I'm testing DSP software on 3G(WCDMA) Node B, in charge of various new features verification for HSPA/HSPA+, and continuous improvement for testing efficiency in our team.

Besides my job related fields, i.e. [radio access](http://blog.pzheng.me/categories.html#radioaccess) and [software testing](http://blog.pzheng.me/categories.html#testing), I'm also interested in [productivity](http://blog.pzheng.me/categories.html#productivity), [reading](http://blog.pzheng.me/categories.html#reading), and [Arch Linux](http://blog.pzheng.me/categories.html#archlinux), etc.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/knoise) or just leave comments on this site.
