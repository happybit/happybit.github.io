Until graduated from school, I didn't consiously realise that software tool could help to improve my productivity. And after woke up, I kept absorbing related information from internet and colleagues. Though I have spent quite a lot time on configuring and customizing various tools, even dropped some of them after deep investigation and study, I still think what I learned and was benefited is much more than what I lost.

Therefore it's time to summarize and share my experience on this topic.

In the following days, I'd like to introduce below tools (yeah, I know you might be disappointed since they are all so popular and well-known):

1. [Everything](http://blog.pzheng.me/blog/2013/08/08/productivity-tools-on-pc-2/)
2. [Launchy](http://blog.pzheng.me/blog/2013/08/08/productivity-tools-on-pc-2/)
3. [TotalCommand](http://blog.pzheng.me/blog/2013/08/19/productivity-tools-on-pc-3/)
4. [DokuWiki](http://blog.pzheng.me/blog/2013/11/10/productivity-tools-on-pc-4/)
5. [Outlook](http://blog.pzheng.me/blog/2013/11/18/productivity-tools-on-pc-5/)
6. [Dropbox](http://blog.pzheng.me/blog/2014/04/13/productivity-tools-on-pc-6/)
7. AutoHotKey
8. Emacs

I will try not to write it in a "manual" or "how-to" way which you could easily find all over the internet, but major focus on why and how I use and integrate them as my own software eco-system. Every tool has its pros and cons. You need to choose your most suitable tools by yourself.
