To be honest, I am not a WP fan, though I am working in Nokia right now. iPhone is dream phone and perfect from all aspects. But it's too expensive. That's why I choose Android.

I customized the home screen of every android phone I have owned, for the same reasons:

* plain text
* battery saving
* I see is what I want in only one screen
* handy (maybe only for myself)

**Attention**: I am not a minimalist, nor perfectionst. I know many details need to improve. (Clock time is incorrect, space, font, etc...) 

Here are the apps in use:

* [Apps Organizer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.code.appsorganizer)
* [SiMi Clock Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.th.android.widget.gTabsimiClock)
* [Simple Calendar Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.j4velin.calendarWidget)
* [Simple Text-Text Icon Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redphx.simpletext)
