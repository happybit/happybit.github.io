I just deployed a new website [Xinyue(新月)](http://www.xinyue.in), which is powered by [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), for my sister *Zehui*, an independent jewellery designer. After graduated from [Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts](http://www.gzarts.edu.cn), she worked as a designer in fashion and garment industry for several years. Later she followed her heart, resigned from company and entered a new field: jewellery design mainly based on jade. As we know, nowadays it's not easy to make a living from designing independently in China. Finally she made it and created a batch of amazing products by herself.

Wordpress is so handy that I only spent half an day to build the site and customize the [theme](http://www.dessign.net/simplephototheme/). Now the rough framework was finished but most of the contents are still under construction. And the price and offer details will be added soon. Sorry for any inconvenience.

I put two pictures of the beautiful products on the bottom of this post. If you feel interested, please go to her website [Xinyue](http://www.xinyue.in) for further check. If you want to buy it, you can contact me or her directly.
