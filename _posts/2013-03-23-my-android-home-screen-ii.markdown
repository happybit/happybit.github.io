Right after posted ["My Android Home Screen"](http://blog.pzheng.me/2013/03/12/my-android-home-screen/), I found another powerful launcher to customize my home screen.

<!--more-->

It is ["Lightning Launcher"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pierrox.lightning_launcher) which is really great on both conciseness and customization. Frankly, it's more powerful than ["Zeam Launcher"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zeam) **from my own perspective**. 

My new screen home is presented below:

The most attactive feature than Zeam Launcher is, no fixed dock on the bottom. Almost every inch of the screen could be customized, which is amazing :-)
